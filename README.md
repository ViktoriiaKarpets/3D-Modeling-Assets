* Scene Composition
* Asset optimization for Game Engines

  ## 🛠 Current Experiments & Skill Building
Beyond game assets, I am exploring **Interior Visualization** to improve my understanding of real-world scale and lighting.

* **Apartment Digital Twin:** I am currently working on a personal project — a complete 3D recreation of my own apartment.
* **Focus:** I model every element from scratch (from layout to furniture) to practice architectural accuracy and high-detail asset creation.
